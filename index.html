            <h2>About Me!</h2>

            <hr>

            <p>
                Nowadays, I mainly develop applications and the like on the web,
                however I used to do a lot more lower-level programming (C, C++)
                before moving onto Java. Initially, I learnt Java so that I could
                use LibGDX - a Java game engine, and I made <i>countless</i> games
                with this. I then moved onto more useful applications of Java,
                making a very basic maths library, and then an IDE for Python and
                Ruby!
            </p>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, the first language I learnt (besides English, of
                course!) was Ruby. To this day, it remains my absolute favourite
                language because of its amazing syntax and simplicity. Now, I
                must've began learning Ruby originally at least 3 years ago, but
                I only picked it back up again a few months ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after I initially started to learn Ruby, I began learning
                web development. Unfortunately, I don't have any of my first
                websites, but I can assure you they were absolutely horrendous!
            </p>
            <p>
                After this, as far as I can remember, I learned Python. This was
                a couple of years ago, and was mainly to go with programming the
                Raspberry Pi. For quite a while, Python was my favourite
                language, since its very simple and easy to learn and use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I've mainly been using C# and Ruby, but very recently
                I've begen to get into web development, which is becoming one of
                my favourite things - certainly more than command line application
                development.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the languages which I know are: <br /><br />
                &nbsp;- C / C++ <br />
                &nbsp;- Java <br />
                &nbsp;- C# <br />
                &nbsp;- HTML <br />
                &nbsp;- JavaScript <br />
                &nbsp;- CSS <br />
                &nbsp;- Python <br />
                &nbsp;- Ruby <br />
            </p>
